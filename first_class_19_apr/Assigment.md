# Assigments:
- Research and list the rules for naming variables in Python.
- Answer: 1.	Start with a letter or underscore: Variable names must begin with a letter (A-Z, a-z) or an underscore (_), but not a number.
2.	No spaces: Variable names cannot contain spaces. Use underscores (_) to separate words if needed.
3.	Only alphanumeric characters and underscores: Variable names can include letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores (_), but no special characters like @, $, or %.
4.	Case-sensitive: Python treats uppercase and lowercase letters as different variables. For example, name, Name, and NAME are three distinct variables.
5.	Cannot be a Python keyword: You cannot use reserved words like class, def, return, or import as variable names.
6.	Use meaningful names: While not a strict rule, it's best practice to use descriptive names like student_id instead of sid or x.
7.	Follow naming conventions:
o	Camel Case: myVariableName
o	Pascal Case: MyVariableName
o	Snake Case: my_variable_name
- Explore the precedence of arithmetic operators in Python.
- Answer: 1.	Parentheses () – Highest precedence; operations inside parentheses are evaluated first.
2.	Exponentiation ** – Right-to-left associativity (e.g., 2 ** 3 ** 2 evaluates as 2 ** (3 ** 2)).
3.	Unary operators +x, -x, ~x – Unary plus, minus, and bitwise NOT.
4.	Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus *, /, //, % – Left-to-right associativity.
5.	Addition and Subtraction +, - – Left-to-right associativity.
6.	Bitwise Shift Operators <<, >> – Left-to-right associativity.
7.	Bitwise AND & – Left-to-right associativity.
8.	Bitwise XOR ^ – Left-to-right associativity.
9.	Bitwise OR | – Left-to-right associativity.
- Explore all string methods in Python.
- Answer: String Modification Methods
•	capitalize() – Converts the first character to uppercase.
•	lower() – Converts all characters to lowercase.
•	upper() – Converts all characters to uppercase.
•	title() – Converts the first character of each word to uppercase.
•	swapcase() – Swaps uppercase and lowercase characters.
String Checking Methods
•	isalnum() – Returns True if all characters are alphanumeric.
•	isalpha() – Returns True if all characters are alphabetic.
•	isdigit() – Returns True if all characters are digits.
•	isspace() – Returns True if all characters are whitespace.
•	isupper() – Returns True if all characters are uppercase.
•	islower() – Returns True if all characters are lowercase.
String Searching Methods
•	find(substring) – Returns the index of the first occurrence of substring, or -1 if not found.
•	index(substring) – Similar to find(), but raises an error if substring is not found.
•	count(substring) – Returns the number of occurrences of substring.
•	startswith(prefix) – Returns True if the string starts with prefix.
•	endswith(suffix) – Returns True if the string ends with suffix.
String Modification & Formatting
•	replace(old, new) – Replaces occurrences of old with new.
•	strip() – Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
•	lstrip() – Removes leading whitespace.
•	rstrip() – Removes trailing whitespace.
•	split(separator) – Splits the string into a list based on separator.
•	join(iterable) – Joins elements of an iterable into a string.
String Alignment Methods
•	center(width) – Centers the string within a given width.
•	ljust(width) – Left-aligns the string within a given width.
•	rjust(width) – Right-aligns the string within a given width.
String Encoding & Translation
•	encode(encoding) – Encodes the string using the specified encoding.
•	translate(mapping) – Translates characters using a mapping table.

  ## Mandatory Pre-Class Task: GitHub Account Setup
All students must create a GitHub account before the next class. Follow these steps:



- Go to **[GitHub.com](https://github.com)** and click **"Sign up."**

- Use your a personal email.

- Choose a professional username (e.g., FirstNameLastName or FirstName_Dev).
- Check your inbox for a verification email from GitHub and confirm your account.



## Why?

GitHub is essential for collaborating on code, submitting assignments, and building a developer portfolio.

We’ll use it actively in upcoming lessons for version control and project submissions.
